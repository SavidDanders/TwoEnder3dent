Gonna build a Voron. Build a Trident


## Things to reuse

* MCU
   * need a second or
   * Ebb36 + PitB
* PSU & AC Inlet
* Heated bed, need to drill in 2 somewhat straight holes
* Motors, need additional
* 2 (1) additional leadscrew and coupler. Recommended to buy steppers with integrated PTFE coated leadscrew


### When coming from a Enderwire

You CAN reuse your existing mgn12, however you need new mounts and thicccc weatherstrips for the panels.

## WHY


### General

* inverted electronics
* shorter reverse bowden
* fast preheating print area
* over bed static fans (RSCD)
* quick and easy underbed fan replacements
* print on eye level, reduce back bending/pain
* additional bottom storage when not printing near max Z
    * filament storage
    * plate storage
    * finished plates /parts can slowly cooldown while printing the next
* easier to tune, less belts to tension equally
* static AB motors easy to extend with dampers, fans or replace for longer


### vs. Switchwire
* stable xy gantry
* internal spool holder
* no Z dragchain, less wire breaking, gantry board is fixed and cable can run inside Z extrusion
* waaaay more mods than SW



## FAQ

* What can i reuse?
   * everything that is not sheetmetal or vwheels and preferable not the frame

## Mods

### Definitly wanted

* Trident inverted Trident Inverted Electronics

### For reusing things

* Reusing leadscrew & coupler to not lose Z height
