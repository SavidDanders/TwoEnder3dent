# Ender3dent
Gonna build a Voron. Build a Trident.

## Things to reuse

* MCU
   * need a second or
   * Ebb36 + PitB
* PSU & AC Inlet
* Heated bed, need to drill in 2 somewhat straight holes
* Motors, need additional
* 2 (1) additional leadscrew and coupler. Recommended to buy steppers with integrated PTFE coated leadscrew


### When coming from a Enderwire

You CAN reuse your existing mgn12, however you need new mounts and thicccc weatherstrips for the panels.

### example price calc

```
siboor kit:
€346.44 requires a v2 or pro

Trident selfsource
 115€ 5xmgn9 + 1xmgn12 (currently overprices, wait for lovers thing to end)
  65€ siboor leadscrew stepper (3 pieces, 15€ each)
  60€ frame
  30€ skr pico as secondary mcu
  50€ Trident screw kit (cheap locally here in metric land tho)
  15€ 5M Gates belts
  12€ 2x 10pc f695 (are 20 enough?)
   5€ spherical bearings
=352 €  (no panels tho)
```

## WHY

### General

* inverted electronics
* shorter reverse bowden
* fast preheating print area
* over bed static fans (RSCD)
* quick and easy underbed fan replacements
* print on eye level, reduce back bending/pain
* additional bottom storage when not printing near max Z
    * filament storage
    * plate storage
    * finished plates /parts can slowly cooldown while printing the next
* easier to tune, less belts to tension equally
* static AB motors easy to extend with dampers, fans or replace for longer
* 250 build can have a internal Spoolroller even with 260 bed (see mods)


### vs. Switchwire
* stable xy gantry
* internal spool holder
* no Z dragchain required and still looking neat
* waaaay more mods than SW

## But V2 is style, V2 is love

If you absolutely must, then feel free to apply the principal of stuffing Ender parts into different Frame to the V2 frame.

## FAQ

* What can i reuse?
   * everything that is not sheetmetal or vwheels and preferable not the frame

How it all started and why you should buy extrusions, they are cheap

> Fun fact 1111 & 1112 battled for the 1111 serial
> technically 1112 is Voron Trident #1111 as they start from 0

Ender 6 are also welcome. (Hint we dont have a Ender2 and Ender5 conversion yet)

Ender3dent with mgn12 aka Enderwire to Ender3dent conversion showing the need for thicker foam (weather stripes in this case)
